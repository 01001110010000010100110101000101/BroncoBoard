Broncoboard is a web service that was created for the class of CS480 Fall 2015 
By Kevin Ali, Dat Do , Sang Choi, and Aruther Le

The issue we are trying to solve by creating this web application is lack of communication between classmates and teachers, and also .
So our team decided to create a service that would provide a place where classmates and teachers can communicate with each other outside of class.
And create a easy environment to collaborate with classmate when assigned a group project. 
We as a group felt that other chat systems such as the blackboard forums, where not sufficient enough as chat.

Broncoboard used the spring io framework as its base for its back end chat and authentication system. 
Bootstrap for most of the front end.
MySQL for the database.
AWS to host the web service
