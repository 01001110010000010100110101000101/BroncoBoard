Broncoboard is a web service created for the class of CS480 Fall 2015 

By Kevin Ali, Dat Do, Sang Choi, and Arthur Le

This web application tackles the issue of difficulty of communication between classmates and teachers.

Broncoboard provides a place where classmates and teachers can communicate with each other outside of class.

It creates an environment to collaborate with classmates when assigned a group project. 

We felt that other chat systems, such as the Blackboard forums, were not adequate as a form of classroom communication.
